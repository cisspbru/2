#                           Kernel for recognaze handwritten digit

In this repository you can find my nootbook kernel for kaggle competion. With this version I achieved 99,485% accuracy on test dataset.
I used convolutional neural networks and Keras library for python(very user-frendly library). Keras library is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano.
